# podClipper app

### Descripton

A problem that I encounter daily as I'm listening to podcasts is that there is not one place that I can keep track of clips that I find particularly funny or insightful in one central location (especially listening across platforms). Additionally, even if I do keep track of clips that I enjoy, there is no easy way for me to search through these clips for identifying features and locate the clip that I want to see. This app is a practical solution, where I can keep track of the podcast clips that I enjoyed and want to have access to later. I implemented filtering based on **people** on the show (both hosts and guests), the **show name**, and any **notes** I take on *why* I enjoyed this clip.

Additionally, this app serves to develop and test my skills operating in the MERN stack
